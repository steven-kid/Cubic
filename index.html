          As a result, what we do remember is anything that makes others happy, anything that makes ourselves unhappy, totally forgetting that there is something happy in our own life.

          What is an Algorithm? Algorithm Basics
        </h3>
        <p class="reveal fade-bottom">
          The word Algorithm means ‚Äù A set of finite rules or instructions to be followed in calculations or other
          problem-solving operations ‚Äù Or ‚Äù A procedure for solving a mathematical problem in a finite number of steps
          that frequently involves recursive operations‚Äù.
        </p>
        <p class="reveal fade-bottom">
          Therefore Algorithm refers to a sequence of finite steps to solve a particular problem.
          Algorithms can be simple and complex depending on what you want to achieve.
        </p>
        <img src="./img/What-is-Algorithm.jpg" class="reveal fade-bottom" alt="">
        <p class="reveal fade-bottom">
          It can be understood by taking the example of cooking a new recipe. To cook a new recipe, one reads the
          instructions and steps and executes them one by one, in the given sequence. The result thus obtained is the
          new dish is cooked perfectly. Every time you use your phone, computer, laptop, or calculator you are using
          Algorithms. Similarly, algorithms help to do a task in programming to get the expected output.

          The Algorithm designed are language-independent, i.e. they are just plain instructions that can be implemented
          in any language, and yet the output will be the same, as expected.
        </p>
        <h3 class="reveal fade-bottom">What is Dynamic Programming?</h3>
        <p class="reveal fade-bottom"> 
          Dynamic Programming is mainly an optimization over plain recursion. Wherever we see a recursive solution that
          has repeated calls for same inputs, we can optimize it using Dynamic Programming. The idea is to simply store
          the results of subproblems, so that we do not have to re-compute them when needed later. This simple
          optimization reduces time complexities from exponential to polynomial.
        </p>
        <p class="reveal fade-bottom"> For example, if we write simple recursive solution for Fibonacci Numbers, we get exponential time
          complexity and if we optimize it by storing solutions of subproblems, time complexity reduces to linear.
        </p>
        <h3 class="reveal fade-bottom">What is igem?(Internationally Genetically Engineered Machine)</h3>
        <p class="reveal fade-bottom">iGEM is an academic competition aimed at improving peoples‚Äô understanding of synthetic biology while also
          developing an open community and collaboration between groups. It is the most renowned Synthetic Biology
          competition for students. The competition began in 2004 and now has over 300 teams competing from locations
          around the world. The various teams all aim to design and engineer a new method of improving using synthetic
          biology. Projects range from improving the environment to producing new medicines or materials to colonizing
          other planets.</p>

          What is Wiki?
        </h3>
        <p class="reveal fade-bottom">
          A wiki is a website that allows the site visitors to add and edit content. Generally, site visitors use their
          browser to edit text without requiring HTML code. Additionally, some Wikis allow adding and editing of
          graphics, tables and interactive components.

          The term wiki may also simply refer to the software used to create such a Web site.

          A blog site, by contrast, does allow visitors to add content, but does not usually allow them to change or
          edit previous comments from others

          The 2022 iGEM Competition is now over

        <p class="reveal fade-bottom">
          2022 was a milestone year, culminating with the first in-person gathering for the iGEM Grand Jamboree in
          Paris, a major undertaking that was nearly 4 years in the making. An international panel of 370 judges cast
          their votes to select the winning teams, and the results were impressive ‚Äì with 173 teams earning gold medals,
          94 teams earning silver, and 57 teams earning bronze. Congratulations to ALL teams! See the results.

          The iGEM Cycle: How to Navigate the iGEM Competition
        </h3>
        <p class="reveal fade-bottom">
          The natural world is filled with cycles ‚Ä¶ the carbon cycle, the cell cycle, the cycling of the seasons ‚Ä¶ to
          name a few. A cycle is also apparent in the iGEM Competition, where teams work with nature in engineering
          biology to solve local problems and tackle global challenges.
        </p>
        <p class="reveal fade-bottom">
          Starting an iGEM team and getting a project started in the iGEM Competition can be a challenge, even for
          returning teams. We have prepared this guide to help you understand what to expect throughout the iGEM
          Competition Cycle, whether this is your first time participating, or you are returning as a seasoned veteran.

          OFF SEASON PHASE (DECEMBER-JANUARY)
        </h3>
        <p class="reveal fade-bottom">
          During the competition season, there are 3 active phases in the iGEM cycle. While not all teams follow this
          cycle (for example, you may want to start work earlier or later than shown here, or you are working on a
          software project without a wet lab component), the major tasks within the 3 active phases of the competition
          season include:
        </p>
        <h3 class="reveal fade-bottom">
          PHASE 1 (FEBRUARY-MAY)
        </h3>
        <p class="reveal fade-bottom">
          1. Start a Team
          <br>
          Decide the final team from the group of interested students.
        </p>
        <p class="reveal fade-bottom">
          2.Brainstorm Project Ideas
          <br>
          Ideally, iGEM projects are entirely conceived, led and driven by students. Many teams will have multiple
          brainstorming sessions, sometimes with and sometimes without the team instructors.
        </p>
        <p class="reveal fade-bottom">
          3.Determine Team Goals and Tasks
          <br>

          This can be challenging, but well worth the effort in the end. A list of high level goals and a detailed list
          of tasks needed to reach those goals will help your team stay focused on the project.
        </p>
        <p class="reveal fade-bottom">
          4.Read the Competition Requirements
          <br>
          Make sure that your team has covered all aspects of the requirements, deliverables, and deadlines, as some
          aspects may be very important to know before starting to plan your project. This should be the responsibility
          of the entire team and not the sole responsibility of one team member.
        </p>
        <h3 class="reveal fade-bottom">
          PHASE 2 (JUNE, JULY, AUGUST)
        </h3>
        <p class="reveal fade-bottom">
          1.Start Work on Project
          <br>
        </p>
        <p class="reveal fade-bottom">
          For wet lab work, you should get trained in protocols and follow your school's safety regulations, and start working on your project. You must also follow iGEM‚Äôs safety rules and policies throughout your project.
          2.Build Your Designs
          <br>
          Order your DNA, and assemble your genetic devices and systems.
        </p>
        <p class="reveal fade-bottom">
          3.Run Functional Experiments and/or Models
          <br>
          This can be done throughout the cloning process once you have a functional device. Test your device and collect your data.
        </p>
        <p class="reveal fade-bottom">
          4.Process and Plot Your Results
          <br>
          Determine which software you need to use to process your data, determine the units you want to display, and make sure you include your controls during data analysis and show them on your graphs/plots.
        </p>
        <p class="reveal fade-bottom">
          5.Work on your Team Wiki and Registry Part pages
          <br>
          Good project documentation is essential for communicating your project to the world. You should be continually working on your Team Wiki and Registry Part pages throughout the project. Don't wait until the last minute!
        </p>
        <h3 class="reveal fade-bottom">
          PHASE 3 (SEPTEMBER, OCTOBER, NOVEMBER)
        </h3>
        <p class="reveal fade-bottom">
          1.Create Materials to Showcase Your Project
          <br>
          Once you have your final data plotted and ready to show, you should create materials to showcase your project at the Jamboree. 
        </p>
        <p class="reveal fade-bottom">
          2.Finalize Your Project Documentation
          <br>
          Now is the time to finalize your documentation, including Team Wiki, Registry Part Pages, and Judging Form.
        </p>
        <p class="reveal fade-bottom">
          3.Prepare and Practice Your Presentation
          <br>
          Similar to your Team Wiki, you should work on your presentation all throughout the project. Practice your presentation in front of a live audience to develop your presentation skills, and integrate feedback to refine the content.
        </p>
        <p class="reveal fade-bottom">
          4.Attend the Grand Jamboree in Paris
          <br>
